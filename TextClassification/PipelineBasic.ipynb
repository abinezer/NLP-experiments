       "'this has been an extraordinary year for australian films . \\r\\n \" shine \" has just scooped the pool at the australian film institute awards , picking up best film , best actor , best director etc . to that we can add the gritty \" life \" ( the anguish , courage and friendship of a group of male prisoners in the hiv-positive section of a jail ) and \" love and other catastrophes \" ( a low budget gem about straight and gay love on and near a university campus ) . \\r\\ni can\\'t recall a year in which such a rich and varied celluloid library was unleashed from australia . \\r\\n \" shine \" was one bookend . \\r\\nstand by for the other one : \" dead heart \" . \\r\\n>from the opening credits the theme of division is established . \\r\\nthe cast credits have clear and distinct lines separating their first and last names . \\r\\nbryan | brown . \\r\\nin a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . \\r\\nthe local police officer has the task of enforcing \" white man\\'s justice \" to the aboriginals . \\r\\nthese are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . \\r\\nnaturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is \" payback \" . \\r\\nan eye for an eye . \\r\\nrevenge . \\r\\nusually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient\\'s thigh . \\r\\nbrown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . \\r\\nhe admits that he has to \\'bend the rules\\' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal \" payback \" . \\r\\n ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . \\r\\nthe local priest - an aboriginal , but in the \" white fellas \" church - has a foot on either side of the line . \\r\\nhe is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . \\r\\nernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . \\r\\nhe is part churchman and part politician . \\r\\nhowever the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . \\r\\nwhilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . \\r\\nhe takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . \\r\\nshe appears to not know this . \\r\\ntony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . \\r\\nhe then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . \\r\\nthe community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it\\'s payback time . \\r\\nthe fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . \\r\\neveryone is affected in the fall out . \\r\\nto say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . \\r\\nsuffice to say it\\'s a rewarding experience . \\r\\nbryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . \\r\\nhis officer is real , human and therefore flawed . \\r\\nbrown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . \\r\\nit wasn\\'t long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . \\r\\nthe wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it\\'s vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . \\r\\nthe cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . \\r\\nat least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon \\'invaders\\' : \" jedda \" , \" the chant of jimmie blacksmith \" and \" the last wave \" . \\r\\nin a year when the race \\'debate\\' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as \" dead heart \" . \\r\\nthe aboriginal priest best sums this up . \\r\\nhe is asked to say if he is a \" black fella or white fella \" . \\r\\n'"
